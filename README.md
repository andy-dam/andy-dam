My name is Andy Dam, and I'm from Spring, TX. I am currently attending the University of Texas at Dallas studying towards a B.S. in Computer Science. â˜„

Right now, I'm very interested in software developmentâš™, web designâŒ¨, app developmentðŸ“±, and the use of AIðŸ§ . Languages and frameworks I have worked with include Java, C++, Javascript, Dart, and Flutter. Ones that I'm studying right now are C++ and Javascript (on my own time).

I'm open to any tips, advice, and internship opportunities in the computer science world, so please feel free to reach out to me about these topics!
